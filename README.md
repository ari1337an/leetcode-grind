# 🧠 LeetCode Grind

Welcome to my structured LeetCode grind — a personal repository of algorithm and data structure problem solutions I'm solving daily to sharpen my skills and prepare for top-tier software engineering interviews.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🚀 Solve 300+ LeetCode problems with clean, readable code
- 💡 Master core DSA topics (DP, Trees, Graphs, Sliding Window, etc.)
- 🛠 Build long-term consistency and depth over speed
- 📈 Prepare for technical interviews (FAANG, startups, remote roles)
